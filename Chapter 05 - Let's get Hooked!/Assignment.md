## Namaste React Course by Akshay Saini
# Chapter 05 - Let's get Hooked!


## Theory Assignment:
- What is the `difference` between `Named export`, `Default export`, and `* as export`?
- What is the `importance` of `config.js` file?
- What are `React Hooks`?
A: Because of React is really good at DOM operations, 
- Why do we need `useState Hook`?
A:  whenever a state veriable updates (serState call) react will rerender that component


React use "Reconciliation algorithum", also known as (react fiber-2016), suppose i have 7 restaurent card, i applied filter and now i have 3 restaurent cards. What happen React use vitual DOM.vitual DOM is representation of actual DOM (Object).
"Diff algorithum" finds difference between two virtual DOMs then according the difference it updates the DOM.

## MIcro services:
big companies use micro service archetecture, eg. UI- React, BackEnd-Java, DataBase-Puthon, SMS-GoLang, Email, Auth. SO we can use different techstacks for different services. 
# How All are the service connected ?
A: Like our all services run on there specific ports like UI service port: 1234, backENd port: 4567, DataBase port :1000, and at end all these services are mappped to domain name. /sms, /api, /ui, /email.
